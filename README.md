# CovidTM — Translation memories for all COVID-19-related content

`Status as of Apr 8:` **`2,800,000 entries in 4 languages`**

## What is this?

CovidTM is a public multilingual corpus of translation memories (TMX files) related to the COVID-19 outbreak: scientific articles, international updates, corporate policies, and so on. ([What for?](https://www.smartcat.ai/blog/covidtm/))

## How do I use it?

1. Clone the repo on your hard drive or just download the required TMX file(s) for your language(s) manually.
2. [Upload](https://gyazo.com/94bca1f9b2d19044c8f89efc4320345d) the TMX to your CAT tool. 
3. [Connect](https://gyazo.com/0568a3dd57ffc2a77c40f110d9e57c50) the TM to your project and use [concordance search](https://gyazo.com/5e13fd014b57948565e4f362717e2b54) to translate faster and more consistently.

Notes:
1. Processing large TMs may take a few minutes. A good CAT tool will allow you to continue working and using new entries as they are being added. 
2. Some of the entries currently seem to be erroneous. Most CAT tools should be able to weed them out while importing the other ones.

## How do I participate?

1. Contact the rightholder and [ask](https://www.smartcat.ai/blog/covidtm/#inquiry) them if they are okay with your sharing the source & translated content.
2. [Download](https://gyazo.com/a2b69dbb117ffbbcc86d7b08c8ad2ad4) your project’s TMX.
3. Submit the TMX via [this form](https://bit.ly/covidtm-submit).
