# CovidTM — Translation memory for all COVID-19-related content

## What is this?

CovidTM is a public multilingual corpus of texts related to the COVID-19 outbreak: scientific articles, international updates, corporate policies, and so on.

## How do I use it?

1. Clone the repo on your hard drive or just download the TMX file manually.
2. Upload the TMX to your CAT tool (e.g. on [Smartcat](https://gyazo.com/365d93fc7d9804dd96832e52dead0cae)).
3. Use [concordance search](https://help.smartcat.ai/hc/en-us/articles/115002043791-Concordance-search) to translate faster and more consistently.
